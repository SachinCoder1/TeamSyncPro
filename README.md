## ‚ö° How to Run the Project Locally

To run **TeamSyncPro** locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js
- Redis

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sachincoder1/teamsyncpro.git
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
You need to create a .env file in both the client and backend directories with the following environment variables:

#### Client Directory (client/.env):
```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=example
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

NEXT_PUBLIC_GUEST_LOGIN_EMAIL=guest@example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GUEST_LOGIN_PASSWORD=password
```


#### Backend Directory (backend/.env):
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myDatabase
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret
```


Make sure to replace <username>, <password>, and other placeholders with actual values.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the client and backend directories, and install the required dependencies:

For the Client:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

For the Backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Step 4: Redis Setup
Ensure that [Redis](https://redis.io/) is installed on your local machine. If you don't have Redis installed, you can follow the official [installation guide](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/) on the Redis website.

Once Redis is installed, start the Redis server by running (for ubuntu/wsl):
```bash
sudo service redis-server start
```

Once Redis is running, you can test it by running redis-cli:
```bash
redis-cli
```



### Step 5: Run the Application
Running the Client:
For development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

For production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```


Running the Backend:
For development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```



### Step 6: Docker Setup
To simplify the setup, you can also use Docker to run the entire application (both frontend and backend) in containers.

First, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.
Navigate to the root of the repository where the docker-compose.yml file is located.
Run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```


This will automatically build and start the frontend and backend services, along with the MongoDB and Redis services.

### Step 7: Access the Application
Client (Frontend): http://localhost:3000
Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api/v1
You should now be able to access TeamSyncPro locally!
